      ## Notes

      // we also KNOW how these following topics are used or implemented,
      //      we have studied them carefully
      // but we thought they were not necessary for our topic so we didn't include them
      //      Vectors & Arrays: we thought that ArrayList was more efficient to use
      //      Two dimensional Arrays: this is unnecessary,
      //          we also didn't implement 2d arrays,
      //
